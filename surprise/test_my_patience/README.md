Hi there,

We found This executable on the local watchmaker's computer.

It is rumored that somehow the watchmaker was the only person who succeeded to crack it.

Think you're as good as the watchmaker?

Note: This file is not malicious in any way

## Solution

This one is packed and also anti disassembly / debugging techniques where used.

The easiest way to solve it is to do the following:

- Run the exe.
- Use OllyDump to dump the unpacked PE file.
- Statically analyze the code, easily find out the key.
